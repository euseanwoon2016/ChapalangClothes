## How to use

1. Clone the repository
2. Use the provided `chapalang.sql` file to import the database, or not it doesn't matter.
3. Use `wamp` or `xampp`, preferably `wamp`, cuz thats what I used. Put it in the appropriate folder according to what you use, i.e `htdocs` for xampp and `www` for wamp.
4. Put in the correct credentials in [`database.php`](https://github.com/euseanwoon2016/ChapalangClothes/blob/main/includes/database.php).
5. Start `wamp`/`xampp`, cross your fingers and access the site.
